# PythonScript

Here are some Python scripts.

# How to Start

If you don't have Python, maybe you should install python first.
Do like this.

1. `brew install python`
2. `brew cask install mysql-connector-python`
3. `pip install virtualenv`
4. `virtualenv --no-site-packages venv`
5. `source venv/bin/activate`
6. `pip install python-mysql`
7. `pip install pandas`
8. `deactivate`

Then, try it.

# Suggestion

- I just tell you how to use this code. But if you want to push your code to GitHub, please add this in your `.gitignore`
```
    *.conf
```
